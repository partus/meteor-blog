## Blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/meteor-blog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Differential/meteor-blog)

This Meteor package gives you a basic, out-of-the-box blog at `/blog`. We wanted
something to work with that uses Iron Router, Bootstrap 3, and didn't require
us to run another dyno for a meteor-based blog.

See full [documentation](http://github.differential.io/meteor-blog/).
